# HexValueVideoProcessing
Extracting and Overlaying Hex Values from Video Frames
Introduction:
In today's digital world, visual data processing plays a crucial role in various applications. One common task is extracting meaningful information from video frames. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to extract the RGB values from a video's region of interest (ROI) and overlay them as hex values on the frames using Python and OpenCV. This technique can be useful in scenarios such as color analysis, visual debugging, or data visualization. So, let's dive in and learn how to implement this video processing technique step by step.

Step 1: Setting up the Environment
To begin, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. We'll be using OpenCV, which can be installed via pip:pip install opencv-python

Step 2: Loading the Video and Selecting ROI
In this step, we'll load the video file and define the region of interest (ROI) within each frame. The ROI is the area from which we'll extract the RGB values. We'll use OpenCV's VideoCapture class to read the video frames, and we'll create a window to select the ROI using mouse events. Once the ROI coordinates are selected, we'll extract the corresponding region from each frame.

Step 3: Extracting and Overlaying Hex Values
Now that we have the ROI for each frame, we can extract the RGB values from it. We'll split the ROI into its respective color channels (red, green, and blue) using OpenCV's split() function. Next, we'll convert the BGR values to hex format and store them in a list.
To overlay the hex values on the frames, we'll iterate through the hex values and use OpenCV's putText() function to display the hex values at their corresponding positions in the ROI. Additionally, we'll create a white background for better visibility and overlay the hex values on it.

Step 4: Writing the Processed Video
Finally, we'll create an output video file and write the processed frames with the overlaid hex values. We'll use OpenCV's VideoWriter class to accomplish this. The output video will maintain the same dimensions and frame rate as the input video.
